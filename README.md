This repository showcases my coursework from the UT Austin iOS Mobile Computing course. These projects reflect hands-on experience building real iOS applications with Swift, UIKit, Core Data, and other frameworks. Each project helped reinforce skills in software design, UI/UX, persistence, and Apple development best practices.

Below is a summary of the apps included in this repo:

| Project | Description | Tech Stack |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **SwiftBasicsPlayground**<br>(`01_SwiftBasicsPlayground`) | A Swift playground exploring syntax, conditionals, loops, functions, and closures. | Swift |
| **LoginFlowUIKit**<br>(`02_LoginFlowUIKit`) | A basic multi-screen login/sign-up app using UIKit and programmatic navigation. | Swift, UIKit |
| **DelegationDemo**<br>(`03_DelegationDemo`) | Demonstrates delegation by passing data between view controllers. | Swift, UIKit |
| **PocketCalculator**<br>(`04_PocketCalculator`) | A functioning calculator app that handles basic operations and user input validation. | Swift, UIKit |
| **PizzaBuilder_CoreData**<br>(`05_PizzaBuilder_CoreData`) | A pizza customization app using Core Data to store previous orders. | Swift, UIKit, Core Data |
| **PizzaBuilder_Plus**<br>(`06_PizzaBuilder_Plus`) | An improved pizza builder app with a better UI and refined Core Data management. | Swift, UIKit, Core Data |
| **TimerList**<br>(`07_TimerList`) | A timer app that lets users create, edit, and track multiple countdown timers. | Swift, UIKit, NotificationCenter |
| **ClickCounter**<br>(`08_ClickCounter`) | Simple counter with persistent storage using `UserDefaults`. | Swift, UIKit |
| **GestureBoxGame**<br>(`09_GestureBoxGame`) | A small game that reacts to tap, swipe, and long-press gestures. | Swift, UIKit, Gesture Recognizers |
| **SwiftUILoginDemo**<br>(`10_SwiftUILoginDemo`) | Login and sign-up screens built using SwiftUI. | Swift, SwiftUI |
| **JoinMeMeetupPlanner**<br>(`11_JoinMeMeetupPlanner`) | Capstone **team project (4 devs)** — social meet-up planner; I led Core Data schema and Google Places integration. | Swift, UIKit, Core Data, Google Places API |
